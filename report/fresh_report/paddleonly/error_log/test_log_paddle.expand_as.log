[paddle error] paddle.expand_as(Tensor([10, 2, 30, 30],"float16"), Tensor([10, 2, 30, 30],"float16"), ) 
 (NotFound) The kernel with key (GPU, Undefined(AnyLayout), float16) of kernel `expand_as` is not registered and fail to fallback to CPU one. Selected wrong DataType `float16`. Paddle support following DataTypes: float32, bfloat16, bool, int64, float64, int32.
  [Hint: Expected kernel_iter != iter->second.end(), but received kernel_iter == iter->second.end().] (at /root/Paddle/paddle/phi/core/kernel_factory.cc:388)
